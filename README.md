**Problem Overview:**

**Problem Statement ID:** 1757

**Problem Statement Title:** India Post - A Bridge for Indian Diaspora to access things Indian

**Description:** 

The Department of Posts (DoP) covers around 219 countries where a large Indian diaspora exists.  While there is a demand for Indian products (Puja Samagri, traditional attire, handicrafts), the current e-commerce landscape presents challenges:

* **Quality Assurance:** PIOs often cannot verify product quality when purchasing online.
* **High Transportation Costs:** Shipping from India can be expensive.
* **Limited Reach for Artisans:** Local sellers and artisans lack resources and information to reach a global audience. 

**Solution:**

Our application aims to address these challenges by:

1. **Connecting PIOs with Local Sellers/MSMEs/Artisans:** Facilitating direct interaction and enabling personalized shopping experiences.
2. **Onboarding Sellers:** Providing a platform for local sellers to showcase their products and reach a wider market.
3. **Integrating Data:** Utilizing global Indian diaspora data (income, consumption patterns) and AI/ML to identify target populations and personalize recommendations.
4. **Ensuring Quality and Affordability:** Implementing buyer and seller registration processes to maintain quality standards and offer competitive shipping costs.
