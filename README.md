**Project Description:**

Diaspora-Connect, is an e-commerce platform designed to bridge the gap between the Indian diaspora and their cultural roots. We offer a curated selection of authentic Rakhis and handicrafts, sourced directly from artisans across India. Our platform leverages the reliability and reach of India Post to ensure timely and secure delivery to customers worldwide. 

**Problem Overview:**

**Problem Statement ID:** 1757

**Problem Statement Title:** India Post - A Bridge for Indian Diaspora to access things Indian

**Description:** 

The Department of Posts (DoP) covers around 219 countries where a large Indian diaspora exists.  While there is a demand for Indian products (Puja Samagri, traditional attire, handicrafts), the current e-commerce landscape presents challenges:

* **Quality Assurance:** PIOs often cannot verify product quality when purchasing online.
* **High Transportation Costs:** Shipping from India can be expensive.
* **Limited Reach for Artisans:** Local sellers and artisans lack resources and information to reach a global audience. 

**Solution:**
